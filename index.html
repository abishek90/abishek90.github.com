<h1> Abishek Sankararaman </h1>
<p>
	I am currently a first year graduate student at the Wireless Networking and Communications Group (WNCG) in The University of Texas at Austin.  I am advised by Prof. Francois Baccelli in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department.
</p>

<p>
	Prior to this, I was at Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai where I completed my dual degree (Bachelors and Masters) In Electrical Engineering (Bachelors) and Communication Engineering (Masters) and a minor degree in Mathematics in May 2013.
</p>

<p>
	Before that, I spent majority of my childhood with my parents and my brother in the wonderful city of Bengaluru in Karnataka, India. 

</p>
<p>
	My current professional interests lie in Applied Probability and Stochastics. To this effect, my current research effort focuses on applying tools from Stochastic Geomtery to characterize performance of wireless protocols. 
</p>
<p>
	I am also braodly interested in the applications of probaility and randomness in designing algorithms for various applications. I am particularly intrigued at the power of randomness in aiding to solve problems of deterministic nature.
</p>
In the past, I have worked with Prof. Radhakrishna Ganti at IIT Madras for my final year Dual Degree project. My work there was on theoretical understanding the minimal amount of noisy data required to reconstruct large sparse graphs. This project involved ideas from Random Graph theory and Probability in analyzing the lower bound on data required. (Details in here)

	I have also been fortunate to have worked with Dr. Balakrishnan (Murali) Narayanaswamy at IBM Research, India. At IBM, Dr.Murali and I worked on developing optimization and learning algorithms for the sparse and noisy state estimation in distribution grids at the last mile of the Power grids. We then combined these estimates with congestion control ideas from Internet design to reduce and mitigate power distribution losses in the Electrical Power grid. (Details in here)
